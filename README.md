Project Components
- Data collection from a Pokémon dataset containing stats, types, and abilities
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers
- Exploratory data analysis using pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries
- Statistical analysis to determine strength based on multiple attributes
- Visualization of findings using matplotlib and seaborn

Key Metrics for Strength Evaluation
- Base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed)
- Total stat points
- Type advantages
- Special abilities and their impact
- Performance across different generations

Outputs
- Ranked list of strongest Pokémon based on composite strength scores
- Visualizations showing distribution of power across different types
- Comparative analysis between legendary and non-legendary Pokémon
- Identification of key attributes that contribute most to overall strength
The project provides valuable insights for competitive players, game designers, and Pokémon enthusiasts seeking to understand what makes certain Pokémon more powerful than others.
